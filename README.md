Project Objective:
MRP (Material Requirements Planning) (Web application)
(CP 15.0)

Overview of the Project
ABC is a group of companies, which are mainly involved with different sorts of plantations. In order to manage the plantations material purchasing from the suppliers, ABC has decided to have a system for the suppliers to submit their tenders and for the Director to compare the prices available. From this system, the director can choose items from different suppliers easily.
This system is an MRP system (Material Requirements Planning). The system is mainly going to deal with tendersâ€™ management which is also known as Purchase Requisition (PR). The idea is after the respective companies prepared their tender list (PR), they will send invite the enlisted suppliers so that the suppliers can bid their prices. The user hierarchy will contain Director (highest privileges), Manager / Executive (to maintain the system), Admin (to support the Manager/ Executive), and Supplier. After the suppliers receive the tender notification, they will submit their bidding prices with the necessary materials/ documents.
To make the whole process more efficient and cost effective, the director (ABC) will be able to select individual items from each supplier after the comparison of the prices. To add to that, after the Director have selected and approved the items from the respective suppliers, the system will automatically generate a unique key Quotation Requisition (QR) for each supplier. To maintain user hierarchy, initially when the suppliers place the bids (prices), low level users like Manager / Executive will not be able to see the price until the tender ends. If it is necessary, the Director will allow the Manager / Executive to view the prices. The admin will not have the access to view the prices.
The system will allow the Manager / Executive/ Admin to add the suppliers manually (typed-in) or by uploading an Excel file from where the system will retain the information and saves the data. Similarly, the QR Order will be able to be created manually (typed-in) or by uploading an Excel file from where the system will retain the information and saves the data. The admin will have access to all the features of the system like Manager/ Executive has except The admin will not have the access to view the prices. These whole processes will be done through this system.
